# Temporary Redirect Attribute

The Temporary Redirect Attribute add-on for Concrete CMS provides a smart and flexible way to redirect pages internally using temporary (HTTP 302) redirects. It introduces a custom attribute type that can be applied to any page in the sitemap. Once configured, the selected page will redirect visitors to another specified page â€” without permanently caching the redirect in the user's browser. This is particularly useful for parent pages like "Legal" that serve only as a container for subpages like "Imprint", "Privacy Policy", or "Terms & Conditions", and where content on the parent page is unnecessary. Unlike permanent redirects that can get hard-cached and cause issues if changes are made later, this add-on ensures that the redirect remains dynamic and always checks the server. It's an elegant, future-proof solution for clean navigation structures and flexible content routing.
